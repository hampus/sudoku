Haskell sudoku solver
=====================

This is a tiny sudoku solver written in Haskell. It's fairly fast for most
puzzles, but the worst case performance isn't great. The focus has been to
write a very short and compact solver that gives reasonable performance. The
whole thing is just for fun, of course.

Build and test run it like this::

    $ make
    $ ./solver < ../example1.txt
